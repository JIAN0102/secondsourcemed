                Our goal is to enable clients the most rapid time-to-market
                possible by providing engineering and manufacturing support to
                expand clients’ capabilities. Creating cost effective solutions
                to the typical resource-constrained manufacturing projects, SSM
                is focused on enabling clients to achieve their potential.
                <br /><br />
                Established in 2004, Second Source Medical was founded to meet
                the growing manufacturing needs of medical device companies
                seeking to reduce costs and speed their time to
                commercialization. The current medical device industry trend
                focuses company efforts on key technologies/critical core
                competencies, often moving away from the traditional
                vertically-integrated business model. SSM provides engineering
                and manufacturing capabilities to companies looking for a new
                way of successfully managing this changing business environment.

                  began while working at ALZA Corporation developing and
                  evaluating polymeric coatings and membranes for transdermal
                  and oral osmotic controlled release drug delivery systems.
                  Leveraging this experience along with a BS degree in polymer
                  processing and materials, Mr. Tsugita has focused his career
                  on bringing new medical products to market. His list of

              medical implants to developing and implementing design changes for
              existing commercial product lines to extend product lifecycles.
              Based on these experiences, Mr. Tsugita saw the need for creating
              a new manufacturing pipeline for medical devices. Second Source
