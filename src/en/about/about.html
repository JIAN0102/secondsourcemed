                Our goal is to enable clients the most rapid time-to-market
                possible by providing engineering and manufacturing support to
                expand clientsâ€™ capabilities. Creating cost effective solutions
                to the typical resource-constrained manufacturing projects, SSM
                is focused on enabling clients to achieve their potential.
                <br /><br />
                Established in 2004, Second Source Medical was founded to meet
                the growing manufacturing needs of medical device companies
                seeking to reduce costs and speed their time to
                commercialization. The current medical device industry trend
                focuses company efforts on key technologies/critical core
                competencies, often moving away from the traditional
                vertically-integrated business model. SSM provides engineering
                and manufacturing capabilities to companies looking for a new
                way of successfully managing this changing business environment.
